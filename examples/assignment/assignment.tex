      Cats can make a `meow', `purr', or `boioioing' sound. \\

    \questionpart
      We must prove that cats are Gods.
      
      \begin{proof}
        Let us assume for the sake of contradiction that cats are not Gods. \\
        This must mean that the world we are living in cannot exist. \\
        But the world we are living in does exist. \\
        This must mean that our initial assumption that cats are not Gods must be incorrect.
      \end{proof}
      
      \finalresult{Therefore, cats are Gods.}
      
  \question
    We must first prove that cats are a number.
    \begin{lemma}
      Cats are a number.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Obviously, cats are a number.
    \end{proof}
    
    Since cats are a number, we can now prove that cats are equal to infinity.
    \begin{proof}
      Let cat be \( x \).
      \begin{flalign}
        &x = x - 1 && \text{(Duh)} \nonumber \\
        \implies &x + 1 = x && \nonumber \\
        \implies &x = \infty && \nonumber
      \end{flalign}
    
      We can clearly see that \( x = \infty \).
    \end{proof}
    \finalresult{Therefore, cats are equal to infinity.}
